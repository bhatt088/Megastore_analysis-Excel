Women drive the majority of sales, but men dominate one surprising category.

While analyzing the annual performance for our mega retail store, one pattern stood out immediately—64% of our sales came from women. Not surprising for fashion retail, right?

But when we looked deeper:

Adults placed the most orders, with women leading across all age groups.

Amazon and Myntra emerged as the top channels, accounting for over half of total orders.

Maharashtra and Karnataka topped the state-wise sales charts, contributing nearly 6M in combined sales.

Order volume stayed steady, but there's a visible dip in Q4 that signals something worth exploring further.

This dashboard wasn’t just about crunching numbers—it helped us understand who our customers are, where they’re shopping from, and how their behavior is shifting across platforms and age groups.

Building this gave me a clear takeaway: even the most obvious data points have deeper stories underneath—if you zoom in the right way.
